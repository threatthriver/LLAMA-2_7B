**AI Chat Assistant with Web Integration**

**Description:**

An advanced AI chat assistant powered by Llama-2-7b-chat-hf that combines web search capabilities with Chain-of-Thought reasoning to provide comprehensive and informative responses. This project integrates various technologies, including transformers, LangChain, and BeautifulSoup4, to create an intelligent conversational agent.

**Features:**

- **Advanced Language Model**: Uses Llama-2-7b-chat-hf for high-quality response generation.
- **Web Search Integration**: Real-time web search capabilities to provide up-to-date information.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Step-by-step logical reasoning for clearer and more comprehensive answers.
- **Customizable System Prompts**: Flexibility to modify the AI's behavior and expertise.
- **Web Scraping**: Intelligent extraction of relevant information from search results using BeautifulSoup4.

**Technical Stack:**

- **Python Libraries**:
  - `transformers`: For handling the language model and tokenization.
  - `langchain`: For building and managing AI chains.
  - `requests`: For web requests.
  - `beautifulsoup4`: For web scraping.
  - `torch`: For tensor operations and GPU acceleration.

**Requirements:**

To get started, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers langchain requests beautifulsoup4
```

**Quick Start:**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/threatthriver/ai-chat-assistant.git
cd ai-chat-assistant
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Chat_With_llama_2_7b_Chat_HF.ipynb
```

**Usage:**

1. The notebook will automatically download and initialize the Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model.
2. Enter your custom system prompt (optional).
3. Input your query when prompted.
4. Receive a comprehensive response that combines AI reasoning with web-sourced information.

**Example Usage:**

```python
# Example system prompt
system_prompt = "You are an AI language model designed to assist with a variety of tasks..."

# Example query
user_query = "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"

# Get response
response = generate_final_answer(user_query, system_prompt)
```

**Important Notes:**

- A GPU is recommended for optimal performance.
- The Llama-2 model requires significant computational resources.
- An internet connection is needed for web search functionality.
- Some websites may block web scraping attempts.
